After 140 hours of development time spanning six weeks, we are very excited to announce the launch of our first game - **Prologue**. This game will give you a brief introduction to our series' two main characters, Becca and Rosalia. You'll get a glimpse of who they are and the relationship they have.

The game has an average playtime of 4-6 hours, during which you'll encounter a variety of different characters and locations. You'll be sent on quests, fight all sorts of enemies, and make some new friends along the way. We encourage you to take the time to explore everything; there are a lot of little gems and funny moments scattered throughout the world.

This is our first attempt at game development, and we used the RPG Maker MZ engine. Our wonderful beta testing team have worked with us to ensure this game is as bug-free as possible, but if you happen to run in to something that doesn't seem right, you can [join our support server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com) and let us know! We'll be staying on top of bug reports and pushing updates/fixes as needed.

And if you love the game (we hope you will!), don't forget you can [make a donation](https://nhcarrigan.com/sponsor), which will help us fund the next game (the next one will be a much longer game!).
