We’ve got news, both good and bad, to share with you! Let’s start with the good news!</p>\n<p>We are very excited to announce that a demo is now available for our next game, Beccalia: Origins! You can grab it on <a href=\"https://nhcarrigan.itch.io/beccalia-origins\">itch.io</a> for FREE today!</p>\n<p>This demo includes the introduction to Becca’s route. It’s about 30-60 minutes long, but should give you a bit of fun. Rosalia’s introduction will be coming soon…</p>\n<p>Except for the not so good news. Unfortunately, our current workload and financial state means we don’t have nearly as much time to dedicate to game development. While we plan to get things done as time allows, we are officially considering the development state to be <strong>on hold</strong> as we simply cannot guarantee any timelines or release dates.</p>\n<p>You’re welcome to join our <a href=\"https://chat.naomi.lgbt\">Discord server</a> for updates on this, and all of our other projects - or for Beccalia specific information, follow our <a href=\"https://mastodon.naomi.lgbt/@beccalia\">Mastodon</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to support our work financially, we have a ton of donation options: <a href=\"https://donate.naomi.lgbt\">https://donate.naomi.lgbt</a>.
