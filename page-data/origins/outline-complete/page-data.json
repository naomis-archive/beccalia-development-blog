It’s been a while since our last update, and we do apologise for that. However, we have some good news to share today! We have finally completed the story outline for our next Beccalia instalment.</p>\n<p>Beccalia: Origins will tell the story of how Becca and Rosalia came into adulthood. You’ll get to see their childhood, the events that led them to start their paths of adventure, and how they came to learn their skills. You’ll also get to see the moment when they first meet!</p>\n<p>This game will be unique in that you will choose one of two paths to follow: Becca’s or Rosalia’s. That means you’ll need to play the game twice to get the full story, but you’ll essentially get two different games in one!</p>\n<p>We still have quite a bit of work to do before actual development starts. We still need to map out the quests, skill sets, enemy lists, and equipment options. We’re hoping to have this done within a month or so, but we won’t be able to provide any planned release date for a while yet.</p>\n<p>The outline, as well as the future information maps described above, are available on our development notes site. This site can be accessed by folks who sponsor us at the Silver tier or higher. If you’re interested in gaining access, check out our <a href=\"https://donate.nhcarrigan.com\">sponsors page</a>.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for your patience! We look forward to providing the next update!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Beccalia Origins - Outline Update","date":"April 10, 2022","description":"We have completed the story outline for the game"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/prologue/release-announcement/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Beccalia Prologue - Release!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/origins/planning-complete/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Beccalia Origins - Planning Update"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"db26c1fa-8f7c-5eec-860b-10db99a74e83","previousPostId":"16db8f8a-4017-5f16-9e5c-402652901d1a","nextPostId":"1498f306-5ed0-5978-a64a-5a4b059a7d20"}},
