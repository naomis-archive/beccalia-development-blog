This means we’ve mapped out the storyline, characters, enemies, skills, items, locations, and quests. It’s a lot of information in a lot of tables, but our hope is that this streamlines the development process significantly - and results in a cleaner and tighter game build.</p>\n<p>Of course, there’s still much planning which will be done on the fly (for example, we haven’t planned any side quests as those will be added throughout the build process). However, the bulk of the information is now at least <em>on paper</em>, so to speak. These notes are, of course, available to sponsors on our development site - so if you haven’t sponsored us yet, this is a good time to do so!</p>\n<p>Our hope is to begin the actual development, starting with loading all of this information into the game database and designing the various maps. We will continue to provide updates both here and on our Twitter account, so give us a follow if you’d like to stay in the loop! For those who are curious, we added about 580 lines of data - which feels like a lot, compared to the scale of our previous games! We thank you for your patience as we continue this process - we intend to deliver the best product possible, even if that takes time.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Beccalia Origins - Planning Update","date":"April 17, 2022","description":"The initial planning stage is finally over"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/origins/outline-complete/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Beccalia Origins - Outline Update"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"1498f306-5ed0-5978-a64a-5a4b059a7d20","previousPostId":"db26c1fa-8f7c-5eec-860b-10db99a74e83","nextPostId":null}},
